# MAGIC ### Question 1: Data Preparation
# MAGIC For the instruction-following use cases we need a dataset that consists of prompt/response pairs along with any contextual information that can be used as input when training the model. The [databricks/databricks-dolly-15k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k) is one such dataset that provides high-quality, human-generated prompt/response pairs. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's start by loading this dataset using the `load_dataset` functionality.

# MAGIC ### Question 2: Select pre-trained model
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The model that we are going to fine-tune is [pythia-70m-deduped](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped). This model is one of a Pythia Suite of models that have been developed to support interpretability research.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's define the pre-trained model checkpoint.

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Question 3: Load and Configure
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The next task is to load and configure the tokenizer for this model. The instruction-following process builds a body of text that contains the instruction, context input, and response values from the dataset. The body of text also includes some special tokens to identify the sections of the text. These tokens are generally configurable, and need to be added to the tokenizer.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's go ahead and load the tokenizer for the pre-trained model. 

# COMMAND ----------

# TODO
# load the tokenizer that was used for the model
tokenizer = <FILL_IN>
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC To setup the fine-tuning process we need to define the `TrainingArguments`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's configure the training to have **10** training epochs (`num_train_epochs`) with a per device batch size of **8**. The optimizer (`optim`) to be used should be `adamw_torch`. Finally, the reporting (`report_to`) list should be set to *tensorboard*.

# MAGIC ### Question 7: Initialize the Trainer
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Unlike the IMDB dataset used in the earlier Notebook, the Dolly dataset only contains a single *train* dataset. Let's go ahead and create a [`train_test_split`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.12.0/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.train_test_split) of the train dataset.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Also, let's initialize the [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) with model, training arguments, the train & test datasets, tokenizer, and data collator. Here we will use the [`DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/data_collator#transformers.DataCollatorForLanguageModeling).
